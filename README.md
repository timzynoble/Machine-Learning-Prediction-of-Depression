# ML Prediction of Depression

## 📌 Project Summary

This repository contains a machine learning project that explores and builds models to **predict the likelihood of depression** using a structured dataset. The goal is to analyze survey or demographic data related to mental health and train models that can distinguish between depressed and non‑depressed cases using Python and common ML techniques.

The original work is inspired by a Kaggle notebook:
